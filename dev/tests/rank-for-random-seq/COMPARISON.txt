Comparison
----------

All files were of size 2800MiB.
Testfile abbreviations:
  rx        : random input over alphabet of size x,
  r255-skew : random input, sigma = 255, 95% of symbols are a, other 254 are 5%,
  r4-skew   : random input, sigma = 4, 95% of symbols are a, {b, c, d} are 5%,
  wiki      : wikipedia xml dump,
  cntr      : countries.

The value is the streaming speed (in MiB/s) during merging of the last
two blocks, each of size 1400MiB (I did the balanced merging).

rank0 is the original rank with alphabet partitioning and fixed block boosting.

TODO
----
  (1) tests with bigger file (6GiB?)
  (2) compare all with cblock = 2^16 (I think it would be interesting to see).
