A guide to installing divsufsort (the recommended way)
======================================================


1. Download and unpack divsufsort-2.0.1

    $ cd
    $ wget https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort/archive/2.0.1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvf ./2.0.1.tar.gz

2. Change settings so that the library compiles to static 64-bit
   version. For this, edit `./libdivsufsort-2.0.1/CMakeLists.txt` and
   change the values of the following options from default values to

option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Set to OFF to build static libraries" OFF)
option(BUILD_DIVSUFSORT64 "Build libdivsufsort64" ON)

3. Check if `cmake` is installed in the system. For this, just type
   `cmake --version`. If cmake is not installed, you will see the
   "command not found" error. In this case, install cmake by typing:

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake

4. Compile and install libdivsufsort in your home directory.

    $ cd ~/libdivsufsort-2.0.1/
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="~" ..
    $ make
    $ make install

5. The library is now installed. We can clean up its source.

    $ cd
    $ rm 2.0.1.tar.gz
    $ rm -rf ./libdivsufsort-2.0.1/

6. It remains to modify the environment variables so that g++ knows
   where to look for header and lib files. For this, add the following
   lines at the end of `~/.bashrc` file.

export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INLUDE_PATH:~/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:~/lib

7. To apply the new .bashrc settings, type

    $ source ~/.bashrc

That's it!
