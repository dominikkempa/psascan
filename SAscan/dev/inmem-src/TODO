* Surprising, that changing log of cblock size does not affect the speed;
  also, changing the 16 to 8 when deciding how many symbols classify as
  rare does not help. What does it mean? Are we blocked by updating threads?
  Actually, first optimization helps for random (for obvious reasons, smaller
  headers), so I'm now permanently switching to cblock of size 1MiB.
  Anyway, investigate this further.
