Ordered roughly by priority (from the most urgent):

* Fix the problems with the merging on 1TiB file

* Fix the computation of starting positions for EM streaming in pSAscan

* Use O_DIRECT for I/O to prevent caching: for starters, implement the
  O_DIRECT version of stream_reader and use during streaming; disk pages will
  still be cached in RAM (due to the use of async_multifile_bitstream_reader
  accessing the gt bitvector), but should do so much slower

* Add an option for running sequentially or parallel (e.g., -j 6)

* Solve the so called "interface issue" in internal pSAscan

* Try the new, 2n-byte rank and implement more generic half-block
  processing (allowing more than two half-blocks)

* Try the possibility of using some wavelet-tree-like data structure in place
  of 4n (or 2n) - byte rank and check if its faster on DNA

* Add an option for computing BWT rather than SA or both

* Add support for full byte alphabet

* Fix this bug (if still present)

  Possible solution: I think we should resolve the paths first.
