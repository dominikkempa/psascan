The algorithm is supposed to be inplace -- meaning that the space allocated for
the output should be used for temp files. Currently this is not the case, as
names of all temp files are created based on the filename of input text, meaning
they will always be created along with the input file.

gt_eof bitvector should probably be deleted rather than kept in memory, when the
peak occurrs.

rare_trunk computation should be first simulated, so know exactly how much memory
to allocate and we don't have to use vector (which can be two times larger than
necesary -- this shows quite significantly when using large RAM sizes).
