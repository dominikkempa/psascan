SAscan - suffix array construction in external memory.
======================================================


Introduction:
-------------

This package contains implementation of SAscan -- an external memory suffix
array construction algorithm. The code accompanies the paper

  Juha Kärkkäinen and Dominik Kempa,
  Engineering a Lightweight External Memory Suffix Array Construction Algorithm,
  In Proc. 2nd International Conference on Algorithms for Big Data (ICABD) 2014.

The latest version of SAscan is available at:
  http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/pads/


Compilation / usage:
--------------------

  1. Download http://libdivsufsort.googlecode.com/files/libdivsufsort-2.0.1.tar.gz
     and install. Make sure to compile libdivsufsort to static 64-bit libraries,
     i.e. set options in the main CMakeLists.txt to

     option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Set to OFF to build static libraries" OFF)
     option(BUILD_DIVSUFSORT64 "Build libdivsufsort64" ON)

  2. Compile SAscan using the provided Makefile

     $ cd src
     $ make

For usage, run program without parameters.


Known issues:
-------------

Current version only works for inputs that do not contain bytes with value 255.
